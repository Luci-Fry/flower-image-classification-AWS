# flower-image-classification-AWS
Utilizes pre-trained models to build an image classifier for classifying flower images. This classifier is built with PyTorch and then converted into into a command line application for use in the terminal.
This project was undertaken as part of Udacity's AI Programming with Python Nanodegree program.

Note: the `workspace_utils.py` is a script inted to work on the Udacity worspace to keep the session from shutting down from prolonged inactivity while training the model.
